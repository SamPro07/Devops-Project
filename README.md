# Devops-Project

## A CI/CD piplines to deploy a three tier application where microservice tools and automation scripts are used. 

The Idea behind this project was to to create a pipline for deploying a three tier application to understand the devops life-cycle process. In order to make this project more challenging than a simple deployment pipeline using only two tools, was to utilise all the most popular tools used in the industry such as Jenkins, Docker-compose, Terraform, Shell-scripting, AWS Services And Kubernetes.
